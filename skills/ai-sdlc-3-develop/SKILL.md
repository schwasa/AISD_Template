# PHASE 3 — DEVELOP

## Fast Track

Replace the full test sequence with a regression test before the fix.
Documentation only → check content and links, no code tests.
Use the UC/task entry; record actual results and phase 3.

## Goal

Implement the current use case using **Test-Driven Development**.

---

## Source of Truth

docs/TASKS.md  
docs/specs/UC-[NNN]-[NAME].md  
docs/PROJECT.md

---

## Test Derivation

Derive tests from the UC.

Acceptance → Integration tests  
Domain rules → Unit tests  
Use case logic → Unit tests  

Locations

tests/integration  
tests/unit  

Prefer **extending existing test files**.

Create new files only if necessary.

---

## Order

1. Integration tests  
2. Unit tests  
3. Implementation

Follow TDD:

RED → GREEN → REFACTOR

---

## Commands

Run the project-specific unit tests documented in `docs/PROJECT.md`.

---

## Rules

- Tests before code.
- Ask the user if requirements are unclear.

---

## Output

Implementation complete.

Unit tests pass.

Record phase 3 and status in `docs/TASKS.md` per `AGENTS.md`.
