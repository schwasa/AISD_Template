# PHASE 2 — DESIGN

## Decisions

- Significant choices → `docs/adr/ADR-NNN-short-title.md` (unused number).
- Record status, context, alternatives, decision and consequences.
- Human acceptance → update `PROJECT.md` and propose durable rules in `AGENTS.md`.
- Preserve superseded ADRs; review related changes together.
- Fast Track → confirm existing architecture in the task entry; skip full DESIGN.

## Goal

Identify the **minimal architecture components** required for the current use case.

Do not generate implementation details.

---

## Input

Current use case

docs/specs/UC-[NNN]-[NAME].md

Architecture reference

docs/PROJECT.md

If the UC does not exist → ask the user.

---

## Steps

1. Read the use case.

2. Determine required components:

domain  
application  
interfaces  
infrastructure  

Examples:

- domain entity
- use case service
- repository interface
- persistence adapter
- API endpoint

3. Ensure the architecture in `docs/PROJECT.md` is sufficient.

Update it **only if necessary**.

Prefer **extending existing artifacts** instead of creating new ones.

---

## Rules

- Do not implement code.
- Do not generate tests.
- Keep architecture descriptions minimal.

---

## Output

Architecture verified or minimally updated.

Record phase 2 and status in `docs/TASKS.md` per `AGENTS.md`.
